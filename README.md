# Database Backup
The **mysqldump** is a command-line utility in MySQL used for creating backups of MySQL databases.
The **mysqldump** tool allows you to dump the structure and/or data of one or more databases into a file, which you can use to restore the databases later.
In practice, you often use the **mysqldump** for **backup** and **restore** operations, **database migration**, and **transferring databases** between servers.
